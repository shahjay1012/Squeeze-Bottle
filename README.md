# 32 oz LDPE Squeeze Bottle — Technical Product Documentation

**Precision Dispensing | Food-Safe | Lab-Grade | High-Volume**

---

## 📘 Product Overview
The **32 oz LDPE Squeeze Bottle** is engineered for controlled, repeatable, and contamination-resistant fluid dispensing across **commercial food-service**, **R&D laboratories**, and **manufacturing** environments.

Designed for high-volume workflows, the bottle leverages **LDPE’s elasticity** to deliver smooth manual pressure response, enabling consistent flow control of:
- Sauces, oils, condiments
- Cleaning agents and solvents
- Laboratory reagents and test fluids
- R&D formulations and prototype materials

Its **uniform blow-molded construction**, ergonomic geometry, and compatibility with standard dispensing caps make it a reliable component in both **manual** and **semi-automated** dispensing systems.

## ⚙️ Engineering Design Details

### **1. Material Engineering — LDPE**
- Selected for **elasticity**, **resilience**, and **chemical compatibility**
- Compliant with common **FDA & NSF food-contact standards**
- Lightweight, non-reactive, and resistant to cracking at low temperatures

**Material Performance Characteristics:**
- Excellent stress-crack resistance
- High tensile elasticity for predictable squeeze force
- Low permeability suitable for food and lab fluids

---

### **2. Structural Geometry**
**Body Profile:**
- Cylindrical or slight taper for ergonomic grip
- Ideal for consistent manual pressure during dispensing

**Sidewall Design:**
- Smooth surfaces for printing, labels, and calibration markings

**Transparency Options:**
- **Translucent (Natural LDPE):** Real-time fill visibility
- **Opaque:** Protection for light-sensitive contents

---

### **3. Neck & Cap Interface**
Standard **28-400 threaded finish**, compatible with:
- Flip-top dispensing caps
- Narrow-tip spouts and cone nozzles
- Portion-control nozzles
- Wide-mouth caps for rapid filling

Ensures seamless integration with common **kitchen**, **lab**, and **industrial** workflows.

---

### **4. Wall Construction & Durability**
Manufactured via **extrusion-blow** or **injection-blow molding**, enabling:
- Uniform wall thickness
- Predictable squeeze characteristics
- High fatigue resistance
- Structural integrity over long-term repeated flexing

---

### **5. Stability & Handling**
- Flat, reinforced base to prevent tipping
- Compatible with automated filling and fixture systems
- Low center-of-gravity for benchtop stability
